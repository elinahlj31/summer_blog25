            <h4>June 13th - My audition for Senior Chamber</h4>
           
            <p> Firstly, I prepared over a few months and practiced everything needed.

            </p>
            <p> Secondly, I began choosing my songs and tried them out! 

            </p>

            <p> After some more prep, I came to this day and was nervous but ready to audition! </p>

            <h4>June 20th - Hotpot with friends</h4>
           
            <p> Firstly, we got a spot on the waitlist and went over to the location.

            </p>
            <p> Secondly, we went in and grabbed our bowls and chose our ingredients!

            </p>

            <p> And then after we paid and waited, we got our food and ate it while talking! It was very good! </p>

           <h4>June 20th - Last choir concert of the year!</h4>
           
            <p> Firstly, our choir rehearsed and practiced our pieces for the show over 2 months.

            </p>
            <p> Secondly, we choreographed some moves into the songs!

            </p>

            <p> And then, on the 20th, we had the concert! It was incredibly fun and also the longest concert because the grads had performances and awards handed out! </p>
