        <p>Over this school year, one of my favourite moments was going to Whistler for the Con Brio Festival! There, me
            and My school's choir stayed for four days, participating in the competition and enjoying the surroundings.

            TO BE DETERMINED!
        </ol>

        <p>One of the places my family and I have discussed as an option for our destination is Ottawa!! It sounds like
            fun and I'm looking forward to wherever we go!</p>

            Ottawa!</a>
        <p>Aside from that, I am looking forward to taking summer school. While I'd rather relax, I'm actually excited
            to take the classes I chose. In case your wondering what they are, I'm taking French 10 and Math 10. These
            are for completion so I'm slightly for nervous. That would mean next year, I'm taking Math 11 and French 11!
        </p>
        <p>Anywayy, let's talk more about the fun things. One of the ideas I had is definitely at a top spot in my
            bucket list to do in the summer. And that is to go to the beach! The idea is unfortunately not swimming.
            Basically, I saw someone bring a pool floatie that was shaped like a bowl and they sat in it on the beach
            with a blanket, a book, and a drink, watching the sunset! That just sounds so enjoyable to me so I want to
            try it out. </p>
