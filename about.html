                    <p>One of my favourite foods is sushi because I love sashimi. I love the fresh taste of each bite and the many varieties sushi has!
                     However, it isn't my only favourite food! I also enjoy eating salads and soups, followed by dishes made from potato! Funny story, from ages 5-12, I used to only eat chicken strips and fries when my family (along with me) went out for food! I am glad I have expanded my tastebuds since then!

                    <p>One of my favourite hobbies is writing because I love how I can express my emotions with creative thinking. Over the years, I've written a few short books and each time, it brings me very much joy to write them! Including Emily Ling, Alley Dog, trouble makers or heroes, and more!
                        Some of the other things I like to do include: Playing badminton, singing, going outside, and more!

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>One of my favourite animals are dogs because they are very loyal, super cute, and fuzzy. Ever since I was 7, my favourite animal has been dogs and I have fantasized about having one! In the future, I hope I can make this dream of mine come true!
                        Other than dogs, I also like bunnies! To me, they are just irresistable! Small, soft and cuddly!
